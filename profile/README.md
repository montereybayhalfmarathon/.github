The Monterey Bay Half Marathon (put on by the Big Sur International Marathon) is an epic run/walk along the scenic Pacific Grove coastline. The gently-rolling, 13.1 mile course travels through historic Monterey, down Cannery Row, along Ocean View Blvd., into downtown Pacific Grove and along the coast to Asilomar and back. Shorter distance 3K and 5K races take place in Pacific Grove on Saturday morning of race weekend. Come for the run and then take some time to enjoy the many pleasures of the world-renowned Monterey Peninsula.
